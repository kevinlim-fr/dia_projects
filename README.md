## Machine Learning & Algorithms

### Minmax Algorithm / Alpha Beta Pruning - Unbeatable AI at Tic Tac Toe - [here](Machine%20Learning%20%26%20Algorithm/Unbeatable%20AI%20Tic%20Tac%20Toe/Morpion-IA.ipynb)
The goal of this project is to create an unbeatable AI at Tic Tac Toe.
It's possible to see 2 AI play Tic Tac Toe untill a Tie, or play against the AI.
The AI is achieved with the implementation of Minmax algorithm to predict the best next move. The implementation of Alpha-beta pruning is to reduce the computing time by skiping worst moves.

### kNN and Confusion Matrix - Iris Flower dataset classification - [here](Machine%20Learning%20%26%20Algorithm/k-NN%20Classification.ipynb)
The goal of this project is to implement ourselves the kNN algorithm and mesure our performance using the Confusion Matrix.

### kNN Classification Challenge - ESILV Classification Challenge - [here](Machine%20Learning%20%26%20Algorithm/Classification%20Challenge%20A3.ipynb)
The goal of this project is to create an unbeatable AI at Tic Tac Toe.
It's possible to see 2 AI play Tic Tac Toe untill a Tie, or play against the AI.
The AI is achieved with the implementation of Minmax algorithm to predict the best next move. The implementation of Alpha-beta pruning is to reduce the computing time by skiping worst moves.


## Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing

## SQL and noSQL Databases
### Cooking - Food ordering platform [here](SQL%20and%20noSQL%20Databases/Cooking%20-%20MySQL%20Database/Summary)
The goal of this project is to create a platform like (Uber Eats) to order food, manage order and payments. 
The additional feature is that each customers can be cooks and they can cook for other customers.
## Repo still under construction, the README file will be completed shortly.
